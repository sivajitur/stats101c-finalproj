# Exploring The Ins and Outs of Yelp: A Machine Learning Approach

## by: Sivaji Turimella, Emma Chi, Helena Hu, Matt Li

The Yelp Dataset is an interesting problem for data scientists and machine learning. With
a slew of data about businesses and locations, itâ€™s important to clean through the data and
figure out what is important and what could be an interesting problem to look at. Employing
NLP Pre-Processing models, we cleaned through review data. After that, we employed a
number of supervised models and a K-Means Clustering unsupervised model to wrangle
through the data. We saw insights in clustering the users into 4 groups. We also see the
important factors in predicting a Star rating of a review.
